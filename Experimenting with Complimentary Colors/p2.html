        <h3>Reason Number 2</h3>
        <p>Water is healthy no matter what form you have it in or what age you drink it. Water not only is a beverage, but can be made into 
          a topping to compliment itself; ice. Water taste especially exceptional when you wake up in the middle of the night dying of thirst.
          Not to mention its versatility. The ability to mix with drink powders or to make slushies with it furthers my point.
