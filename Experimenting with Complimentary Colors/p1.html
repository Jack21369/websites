        <h3>Bob Ross Quotes</h3>
        <p>“We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents.”</p>
        <p>“Talent is a pursued interest. Anything that you're willing to practice, you can do.”</p>
        <p>“There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.”</p>
        <p>“I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Exercising the 
          imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.”</p>
          <p>― Bob Ross</p>

        <h3>Visually Appealing Color Scheme</h3>
        <p>Choosing complimentary colors is quite difficult as their are endless combinations that can be made to
          produce a pallete that is appealing to the eye. Too much contrast results in eye strain, too little makes
          it hard to view the website. That is why I decided to choose colors that are not too contrasting, but are 
          easily visible to the eye.
