      <h2>It's the End of the Journey</h2>
      <p>It has been fun talking to you about color palletes, referencing Bob Ross quotes, going over why water is one of the best beverages, and several fun facts. 
        You will be left with the answer to the homework question below.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Answer to the Homework Question</h3>
        <p>The homework question was: "Answer the following question. Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another 				
          way to organize elements on a page? Hint: The answer is discussed in the CSS Lecture.... and sounds like it could be an 
          unhealthy substitute for butter."</p>
        <p>You can organize elements on a page without using absolute or relative positioning by using margins. Margin sounds like
          margarine, which is a butter substitute.
